You are an expert behavioral analyst. Given a persona's profile, demographics, a product stimulus, and their response, generate a detailed decision trace that explains WHY they responded the way they did.

## Persona Demographics
{{demographics_json}}

## Persona Profile
{{persona_profile_json}}

## Product Stimulus
{{stimulus_json}}

## Persona's Response
{{response_json}}

## Your Task
Analyze the decision-making process and provide a structured trace. For each factor, explain whether it had a positive, negative, or neutral effect on the decision.

Output ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
```json
{
  "persona_factors_used": [
    {
      "factor": "age",
      "value": 28,
      "effect": "positive",
      "note": "Young professional likely open to tech solutions"
    }
  ],
  "stimulus_cues": [
    {
      "cue": "price",
      "value": "$14.99/month",
      "effect": "negative",
      "note": "Slightly above typical subscription comfort zone"
    }
  ],
  "top_objections": [
    "Monthly cost adds up over time",
    "Unsure if AI recommendations will match personal taste"
  ],
  "what_would_change_my_mind": [
    "Free trial period to test the recommendations",
    "Ability to customize dietary restrictions"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "uncertainty_notes": [
    "Limited info about long-term user retention",
    "Unknown if persona has tried similar apps before"
  ]
}
```

Be thorough but concise. Focus on the most impactful factors.
