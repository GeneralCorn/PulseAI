## REPAIR MODE
Your previous response was invalid JSON. Here it is:
{{invalid_output}}

Please fix the JSON and ensure it matches the required format exactly.
{{/if}}

## Your Task
As this persona, evaluate the product concept honestly. Consider your demographics, pain points, and communication style.

Output ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
```json
{
  "scores": {
    "purchase_intent": 1-5,
    "trust": 1-5,
    "clarity": 1-5,
    "differentiation": 1-5
  },
  "verdict": {
    "would_try": true/false,
    "would_pay": true/false
  },
  "free_text": "Your honest reaction in 2-3 sentences, staying in character",
  "top_objections": [
    "Main concern 1",
    "Main concern 2"
  ],
  "what_would_change_my_mind": [
    "What would make you more interested"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "uncertainty_notes": [
    "Any uncertainties about your evaluation"
  ]
}
```

Be authentic to the persona. If they would hate it, say so. If they'd love it, explain why.
