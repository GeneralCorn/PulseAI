You generate a stable persona profile for a synthetic user.

CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
- Output MUST be a single valid JSON object.
- Output MUST NOT include any extra text, markdown, code fences, or commentary.
- Do NOT include chain-of-thought or hidden reasoning.
- Do NOT invent specific real-world facts (exact employer, exact city, exact brand history) unless implied by the input.

CONTENT RULES:
- Avoid stereotypes. Use the given attributes to shape preferences and constraints, not clichés.
- Keep the persona realistic, internally consistent, and reusable across multiple questions/variants.
- Write in English unless demographics_json implies another language.
- Keep fields concise.

REPAIR MODE:
If repair_mode is true:
- You will be given invalid_output.
- Return ONLY a corrected JSON that matches the schema below.
- Preserve the original intent as much as possible; only fix formatting/schema issues.

JSON SCHEMA (MUST match exactly):
{
  "one_liner": string,
  "pain_points": string[],                 // 2-5 items
  "alternatives": string[],                // 2-5 items, generic if unsure
  "communication_style": {
    "tone": string,                        // e.g., "direct", "friendly", "skeptical"
    "verbosity": string                    // "low" | "medium" | "high"
  }
}

Generate PersonaProfile JSON using the persona demographics.

demographics_json:
{{demographics_json}}

repair_mode: {{repair_mode}}
invalid_output (if repair_mode=true):
{{invalid_output}}
